Let's start small and break things down...

1. Refactor store methods to decouple leader writes and follower writes.
    - Modify Set() method to remove the logic that writes to secondary storage (file). âœ…
    - Refactor so that we don't have the names of storage files hardcoded.
2. Implement a WAL:
    - Binary encoding format will be the same used for protobufs.
3. Implement basic logic to manually switch to reading from a follower instead of the leader.
4. Scale read throughput by reading from multiple locations (load balance requests).
